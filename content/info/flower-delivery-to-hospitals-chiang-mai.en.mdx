Need to send flowers to someone staying in a hospital in Chiang Mai? You can do it smoothly if you prepare the right details (patient name + ward + room) and confirm the best drop-off point with the hospital.

## What you need before ordering

- Patient full name (as registered at the hospital)
- Ward / department name (or building name)
- Room number (if known)
- Patient or relative phone number (very important)
- Your preferred delivery time (during working hours)

## Recommended delivery method

1. Message us via LINE or WhatsApp.
2. Send:
   - Bouquet choice + size
   - Hospital name
   - Ward / building + room number (or “unknown” if you don’t have it)
   - Recipient name + phone
   - Preferred delivery time window
3. We will:
   - Confirm availability
   - Confirm delivery feasibility for today (if same-day)
   - Coordinate drop-off (lobby / nurse station / reception—depends on hospital rules)

## Important notes (hospital deliveries)

- Some wards may not allow strong-scented flowers. If unsure, choose roses or mixed seasonal flowers with light fragrance.
- Hospitals may require drop-off at reception or a nurse station (not direct to room).
- If room/ward changes, the phone number helps us confirm quickly.

## FAQ

### Can you deliver to a hospital room?

Sometimes yes, but often hospitals ask deliveries to be left at reception or a nurse station. If you provide ward + room + phone number, we’ll follow the hospital’s preferred procedure.

### What if I don’t know the room number?

That’s okay—send the patient’s full name, the hospital name, and a reachable phone number for the patient/relative. We’ll coordinate the best drop-off method.

### Same-day delivery to hospitals—how early should I order?

As early as possible during working hours so there’s time to prepare, travel, and handle hospital check-in rules.
