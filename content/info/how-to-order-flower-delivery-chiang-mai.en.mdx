Ordering with Lanna Bloom starts on our website. We've put real care into the checkout so it stays clear and comfortable for everyone — and it's the required first step for all standard bouquets.

After you place the order, please [contact us on LINE, WhatsApp, or Telegram](/en/contact) and send your order number or order link. We'll confirm availability and delivery details there, and keep everything in one place.

Sending your order number or link helps us find your order instantly and coordinate smoothly — especially if we need a quick confirmation from you or the driver needs help with delivery details.

For **custom requests** and special occasions, you can start in chat. For standard bouquets, we recommend starting with the website order.

## Overview

1. Choose a bouquet on the [website](/en/catalog)
2. Fill checkout details (recipient, address, date/time, note, message card)
3. Place the order → get an order number + order link
4. [Contact us in chat](/en/contact) to confirm availability and final details
5. Pay after confirmation (PromptPay/bank transfer; Stripe)
6. Delivery during working hours 08:00–20:00

## Step-by-step

### 1) Place an order on the website

Browse [bouquets](/en/catalog) and choose the one you want. Then complete checkout with:

- Recipient name (and phone if available)
- Delivery address (home / condo / hotel / hospital)
- Delivery date and preferred time window
- Note for the driver (building, floor, room, landmarks, parking)
- Message card text (optional)

When you place the order, you will receive an order number and an order link.

### 2) Contact us to confirm

Next, message us here:

- [Contact on LINE](/en/contact)
- [Contact on WhatsApp](/en/contact)
- [Contact on Telegram](/en/contact)

Please send your order link or order number first.

This is how we find your order instantly and confirm everything without confusion.

#### What to send in chat (copy checklist)

**Required**

- Send Hi (to Lanna Bloom on LINE, WhatsApp, or Telegram)
- Send order link or order number

**Strongly recommended**

- Driver notes (landmark, parking, gate code, lobby rules)
- Recipient phone number (if available)

Why this matters: If the driver can't find the location or access is restricted, these details help us coordinate quickly and avoid delivery delays.
