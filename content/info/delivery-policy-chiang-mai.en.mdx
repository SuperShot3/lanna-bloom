## 2) Delivery area

We deliver within Chiang Mai and nearby areas, including: Old City, Nimman, Santitham, Hang Dong, Mae Hia, San Sai, Mae Rim, and surrounding locations.

If you are unsure whether your address is covered, please [contact us](/en/contact) before payment.

## 3) Required confirmation in chat

After placing an order on the website, customers must contact us via [LINE / WhatsApp / Telegram](/en/contact) to confirm availability and final delivery details.

Please send your order number or order link so we can locate your order quickly.

## 4) Address and contact details

Customers are responsible for providing accurate delivery information, including:

- Recipient name (and phone number if available)
- Full address and any access details (building name, floor, room number)
- Delivery notes for the driver (landmarks, parking, gate codes, lobby rules)

If the address or access details are incomplete or incorrect, delivery may be delayed.

## 5) Delivery to condos, hotels, hospitals, and workplaces

We can deliver to condos, hotels, hospitals, and workplaces when access is allowed.

Please include any required details (room number, reception instructions, ward/unit, visitor rules). Some locations may restrict deliveries; in such cases we may need a contact person to receive the bouquet.

## 6) Recipient unavailable / delivery issues

If the recipient is unavailable or the driver cannot access the delivery location:

- We will attempt to contact the customer/recipient using the provided contact details.
- If delivery cannot be completed, we may return the bouquet or arrange redelivery where possible.
- Additional delivery fees may apply for redelivery or changes caused by incorrect details, access restrictions, or failed delivery attempts.

## 7) Delivery timing

Customers can choose a preferred time window. Exact timing may vary due to traffic, weather, and delivery routing. We will follow the requested window as closely as possible.

## 8) Proof of delivery

For quality and delivery confirmation, we may take a photo at the delivery location (for example: bouquet at reception, with the recipient, or at the door when permitted).

We will avoid capturing sensitive personal details when possible.

## 9) Delays and force majeure

Unexpected delays may occur due to traffic, heavy rain, road closures, local restrictions, or other events outside our control. In such cases, we will communicate updates via chat.

## 10) Changes, cancellations, and refunds

If you need to change delivery details or cancel, [contact us](/en/contact) as soon as possible with your order number/link. Outcomes may depend on the preparation stage and delivery status.
